Squirm3 is a simple kind of artificial chemistry, where 'atoms' have a type (a, b, c, d, ...) and a state (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and can react with each other, forming bonds. The atoms move around in a world, forming molecules and membranes. With the right reactions in place, molecules can replicate through template-copying.
